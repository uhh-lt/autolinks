# autolinks
### Automatic proactive researching - a bottom-up interactive information management approach

autolinks is a tool that provides a quick researching platform based on a text or a sentence by visualizing the results together with their semantic relations. autolinks optimizes these concerns and is intended to make the learning process faster and more efficient. Instead of reading papers, websites, and other resources to understand a specific term, this machine will do it for us. From a text or a sentence given by the user, it will read and learn from multiple resources and digests the core related information by visualizing the information in the most convenient way.
